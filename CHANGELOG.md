## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added - Auto-Sync on Login

**Automatic Synchronization**
- Implemented automatic account sync on login for both admin and resellers
- Admin: Syncs all accounts from Stalker Portal
- Reseller: Syncs only their assigned accounts
- Added full-screen loading overlay during sync process
- Users experience seamless loading without knowing sync is happening
- No timeout limit - sync completes regardless of internet speed or account volume
- Preserves existing reseller-to-account ownership mappings across syncs

**Loading UX**
- Added loading spinner overlay with animated graphics in [dashboard.html](dashboard.html:10-14)
- Overlay blocks interaction until sync completes
- Professional "Loading dashboard..." message
- CSS animations for smooth transitions in [dashboard.css](dashboard.css:1339-1375)
- Automatic overlay removal when all data is loaded

### Changed - Currency Standardization

**Currency Code Updates**

- Removed all Persian text (ریال) from currency displays
- Improved currency symbol display logic with fallback handling
- Enhanced balance formatting for all currencies
- Iranian Rial formatting with thousand separators (6,500,000)

**Currency Display Logic**
- IRR displays as "IRR " prefix with comma separators
- Other currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) show symbols with 2 decimal places
- Null/undefined currency defaults to IRR
- Consistent formatting across all pages (accounts, resellers, plans, transactions)

**UI/UX Improvements**
- Improved stat card value typography for better readability in [dashboard.css](dashboard.css:247-257)
- Reduced font size from 36px to 28px for balance displays

- Adjusted font sizes, letter spacing, and line height for better visual hierarchy

### Fixed

**Auto-Sync Implementation**
- Fixed reseller-specific sync logic in [sync_accounts.php](sync_accounts.php:42-54)
- Resellers now only delete and sync their own accounts
- Admin deletes all accounts and syncs everything
- Preserved account-to-reseller mappings across syncs in [sync_accounts.php](sync_accounts.php:87-93)
- Fixed permission checks to prevent resellers from seeing other accounts

**Currency Display Bugs**
- Fixed null/undefined currency handling in [dashboard.js](dashboard.js:167-192)
- Fixed "£10000000.00" showing instead of "IRR 10,000,000"
- Fixed "null 10000000.00" display in adjust credit modal
- Added defensive programming for missing balance values
- Fixed plan price display in dropdowns showing raw decimals (6500000.00)
- Fixed plan table prices not formatted correctly in [dashboard.js](dashboard.js:761-783)
- Improved number formatting consistency across all currency displays

**JavaScript Errors**
- Fixed duplicate `formattedPrice` variable declaration that was preventing page load
- Fixed onclick attribute generation with null values in [dashboard.js](dashboard.js:702-722)
- Pre-process null balance/currency values before HTML generation

**Performance Issues**
- Removed 30-second timeout from auto-sync function in [dashboard.js](dashboard.js:124-141)
- Sync now waits indefinitely for completion (handles slow internet)
- Improved loading state management for large account databases
